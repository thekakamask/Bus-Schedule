# 📚 **Bus Schedule**
**Bus Schedule** is a modern Android application that allows users to find a list of bus stops with scheduled departure times. This app showcases modern Android development practices using Jetpack components including **Room**, **ViewModel**, **StateFlow**, and **Navigation**, and follows the **MVVM** architecture pattern. It leverages **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous operations and persists data locally using an **SQLite database** via the Room persistence library.
